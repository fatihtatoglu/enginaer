# About

When I have started programming, my first IDE was Turbo C. With helpful documents I have learned the C programming language. Turbo C has an important place in my heart. For showing my admiration, I have developed this theme.

While developing this theme I have also used following technologies.

- SASS
- NodeJS
- Javascript
- CSS
